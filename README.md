# cdk-CloudFormationTemplate-bucket
This repository describes the steps i took in creating a S3bucket inside a cf template using AWS CDK

**Step1**
- After setting up my development enivorment accoriding to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html , I created a new directory in my home directory and I also cd-ed into it.

```
mkdir endava-cdk
cd endava-cdk
```

**Step2**
- After the previous step, I initialized AWS CDK using a default app template and Python.

```
cdk init app --language python
```

The cdk init command will create a bunch of files and directories in our main directory, which we created at step1. These files actually represent the structure of the app which we are creating.
Once the initialization is done I installed the required dependencies.

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Lastly, i checked if the stack was created by listing all de cdk stacks

```
cdk ls
```
The output should be something containing the name of the created stack, in my case "EndavaCdkStack"


**Step3**
- I began with adding a S3-bucket to the app which I created.
- I used the following command in order to install the S3 aws package:

```
pip install aws-cdk.aws-s3
```

After that i cd-ed into the endava_cdk directory, which was created by the init process. Once inside i opened the whole directory in vscode and i edited the code as follows:
-I added "_from aws_cdk import aws_s3 as s3_" under the already existing imports
-I replaced the last comment with the following:

```
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, 
    "MyFirstBucket", 
    versioned=True,)
```
**Step4**
- I changed into the previous directory(in order not to specify the app when i synth) and then I synthetised a cf template from the app which i just built with the following:

```
cd ..
cdk synth
```

Everything was done corectly because the output of this command was a cf template in yaml.
```

    Metadata:
      aws:cdk:path: EndavaCdkStack/CDKMetadata/Default
    Condition: CDKMetadataAvailable
Conditions:
  CDKMetadataAvailable ......
```

**Step5**
- In the last step, I deployed the stack using the synthetised yaml template.

```
cdk deploy
```

- In the end, I checked if the stack and the bucket were working from the AWS console.
